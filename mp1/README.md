# Assignment 1: Linear Classifiers

In this assignment, we implement and evaluate various linear classifiers â€” Perceptron, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Softmax, and Logistic Regression â€” on the Rice and Fashion-MNIST datasets.

We experimented with different hyperparameters and learning rate decay strategies to find optimal configurations for each model on both datasets.

## ðŸ“ˆ Models

We implemented the following classifiers (in their respective files):

- **Perceptron** â€” `perceptron.py`
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** â€” `svm.py`
- **Softmax** â€” `softmax.py`
- **Logistic Regression** â€” `logistic.py`

For the logistic regression classifier, multi-class prediction was not attempted as it requires one-vs-rest or one-vs-one strategies, so it was applied only to the Rice dataset.

## ðŸ“‚ Data Setup

To download and set up the Fashion-MNIST dataset, run:

```bash
cd assignment1/fashion-mnist/
bash get_data.sh
```
